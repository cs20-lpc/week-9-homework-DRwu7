# Week 9 Homework

## Directions

You will bring the circular array based `Queue` from Week 9 Wed Lab and linked list based `Queue` from Week 9 Mon Lab. You will bring in the completed code from these labs into this repository.

You will implement a factory class that will have a method `GetQueue` that will return a linked list based queue if there is no length parameter specified. Otherwise it will return a Array based queue.

You are also in charge of writing your own driver program to test your factory class method.
